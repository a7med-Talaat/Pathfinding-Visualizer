# üåü Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer - Interactive Edition

A stunning, high-performance web application designed to bring the world of **Graph Theory** and **Search Algorithms** to life. This interactive tool allows users to build custom environments and visually compare how various pathfinding algorithms navigate the challenges.

Built using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, this project emphasizes clean code and powerful, real-time visualization without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Algorithm Showcase:** Visualize and compare the strategies of five foundational pathfinding algorithms:
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
    * **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores deeply before backtracking.
    * **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Guarantees the optimal path in weighted graphs (treating all cells as uniform weight here).
    * **Greedy Best-First Search:** Prioritizes speed using only heuristic distance.
    * **A\* Search Algorithm:** Combines path cost and heuristic for optimal and efficient performance.
* **Interactive Design (God Mode):**
    * **Draw Walls:** Click and drag to instantly place and erase wall obstacles.
    * **Dynamic Nodes:** Easily move the **Start (S)** and **Target (T)** nodes to any valid position on the grid.
    * **Maze Generation:** Generate complex, instant mazes using the **Recursive Backtracking** method.
* **Performance Metrics:** Get immediate, quantifiable results after each simulation:
    * **Nodes Visited:** Measures exploration efficiency.
    * **Path Length:** Measures the distance of the found path.
    * **Time Elapsed:** Measures the actual execution time.
* **Customization:**
    * **Adjust Animation Speed:** Control the flow to watch the process frame-by-frame or see the final path instantly.
    * **Diagonal Movement:** Toggle between **Cardinal (4-way)** and **Diagonal (8-way)** movement.

## üíª Technology Used

This project showcases the power of fundamental web technologies:

| Technology | Role | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Structure | Semantic layout for the grid and control panel. |
| **CSS3** | Styling & Aesthetics | Modern, responsive design using Flexbox and Grid. Includes **complex custom animations** (`@keyframes`) for visited nodes and the final path. |
| **Vanilla JavaScript** | Core Logic | Implements all five algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Greedy, A\*) and handles all user interactions and real-time DOM manipulation. **No external libraries are used.** |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

Since this is a single-page application, getting it running is fast and simple:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd pathfinding-visualizer-interactive
    ```
3.  **Open the file:**
    Simply double-click the `index.html` file in your operating system's file explorer, or open it directly in your preferred web browser.
